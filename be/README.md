- APIGateway with CORS
- Lambdas executing CRUD operations on DynamoDB
- Cognio for authentication / authorization

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, then the lambda functions' dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk bootstrap` if you deploy the first time.
Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## CDK Toolkit

The [`cdk.json`](./cdk.json) file in the root of this repository includes
instructions for the CDK toolkit on how to execute this program.

After building your TypeScript code, you will be able to run the CDK toolkit commands as usual:

```bash
    $ cdk ls
    <list all stacks in this program>

    $ cdk synth
    <generates and outputs cloudformation template>

    $ cdk deploy
    <deploys stack to your account>

    $ cdk diff
    <shows diff against deployed stack>
```
